              <ul>
                <li>
                  1. Early Warning Systems: Utilize advanced meteorological technologies to monitor hurricanes and issue timely warnings. Ensure a reliable communication system for disseminating alerts to residents and authorities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  2. Public Awareness and Education: Conduct educational campaigns to inform the public about hurricane risks, preparation tips, and evacuation procedures. Encourage residents to create emergency kits and develop family communication plans.
                </li>
                <li>
                  3. Building Codes and Retrofitting: Enforce strict building codes that include hurricane-resistant materials and construction practices. Retrofit older buildings to enhance structural integrity against hurricane-force winds.
                </li>
                <li>
                  4.Emergency Supplies: Stockpile emergency supplies such as non-perishable food, water, medications, and first aid kits. Distribute information on where to acquire supplies and how to store them safely.
                </li>
                <li>
                  5. Evacuation Routes and Shelters: Designate and maintain clear evacuation routes inland or to designated shelters. Ensure these locations are accessible, well-marked, and equipped to accommodate evacuees with basic necessities.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  1. Monitoring and Alerting: Monitor hurricane forecasts and warnings issued by meteorological agencies. Activate early warning systems and communicate evacuation orders through multiple channels
                </li>
                <li>
                  2. Immediate Action: Issue evacuation orders promptly when hurricane impacts are imminent. Direct residents to evacuate using predetermined routes away from coastal and low-lying areas.
                </li>
                <li>
                  3. Gathering Points: Establish safe assembly points or evacuation centers inland or on higher ground. Provide transportation assistance for those without means to evacuate independently.
                </li>
                <li>
                  4. Tracking Evacuees: Implement registration systems or checklists to track evacuees and ensure their safety during evacuation and sheltering.
                </li>
                <li>
                  5. Information Updates: Continuously update residents and the public on hurricane conditions, evacuation routes, and shelter availability.
                </li>
                <li>
                  6. Recovery and Assistance: Assess hurricane damage, coordinate debris removal, and facilitate the return of residents once it is safe to do so. Provide support services for displaced individuals and families.
                </li>

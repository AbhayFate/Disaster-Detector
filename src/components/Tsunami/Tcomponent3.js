        <Container id="main-t">
          <Row>
            <Col>
              <h4>Measures:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  1. Early Warning Systems: Ensure robust systems are in place
                  to detect tsunamis early. Utilize seismic monitoring, ocean
                  buoys, and other sensors to provide timely alerts to
                  authorities and the public.
                </li>
                <li>
                  2. Public Education: Conduct ongoing public education
                  campaigns to raise awareness about tsunami risks and
                  preparedness. Provide information on warning signs, evacuation
                  procedures, and safe assembly points.
                </li>
                <li>
                  3. Evacuation Routes: Establish and clearly mark primary and
                  secondary evacuation routes leading inland and to higher
                  ground. Ensure routes are accessible and well-maintained.
                </li>
                <li>
                  4. Vertical Evacuation Structures: Identify and designate
                  tall, sturdy buildings or structures as vertical evacuation
                  sites in coastal areas where horizontal evacuation is not
                  feasible. Educate residents on their locations and use.
                </li>
                <li>
                  5. Community Preparedness: Encourage community organizations
                  and local leaders to develop neighborhood emergency plans.
                  Foster cooperation and coordination among residents for swift
                  evacuation and assistance.

              <h4>Suggested Measures:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  1. Warning Phase:
                  <br />
                  (i) Alert Notification: Upon receiving a tsunami warning,
                  activate warning systems to alert residents through sirens and
                  other communication methods.
                  <br />
                  (ii) Information Dissemination: Broadcast clear instructions
                  on evacuation routes, assembly points, and safe locations
                  through local authorities and media.
                </li>
                <li>
                  2. Evacuation Phase: <br />
                  (i)Immediate Action: Residents should evacuate promptly upon
                  hearing the warning. Follow designated evacuation routes
                  inland or to higher ground.
                  <br />
                  (ii)Vertical Evacuation: If in a designated vertical
                  evacuation structure, move to upper floors or roof as
                  directed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  3. Assembly and Safety: <br />
                  (i) Gathering Points: Encourage residents to assemble at
                  pre-designated safe locations away from the coast and
                  flood-prone areas. <br />
                  (ii) Accountability: Ensure accountability and safety of all
                  evacuees. Use checklists or registers if feasible to track
                  those who have evacuated.
                </li>
